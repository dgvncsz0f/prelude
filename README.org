PRELUDE

* Introduction

  Prelude follows the principle of Facebook's primer javascript API. By mapping user interactions patterns is helping us boost most of the site functionality with minimum javascript development, as we can generalize most of them.

  There are probably much overlapping with the Facebook's primer API. The main difference is that we use jQuery underneath while they are using Haste + Bootloader.

  If you know primer library, there won't be much news here, other than using jQuery underneath. The purposes, therefore, is not reduce javascript size to the minimum possible, but to reduce greatly development time/cost.

  N.B. There is also some widgets plumbing, which one may say, /correctly/, it shouldn't be part of prelude. That is true, we will ship it separately. Another idea is also ship this as a jQuery plugin.

* Contributors

  I'd like to thank both Paulo Ahagon and David Paniz for helping with the implementation.

* Should I use it?

  Probably not. Besides, this is pretty much the result of a day of work. In near future, when the lib is a bit more polished it may be useful to others, but currently it will probably require a lot of work/hacking to make it functional.
